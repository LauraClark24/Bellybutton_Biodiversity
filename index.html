        <p style="color: rgb(255, 0, 0);">Many bacterial species are not well studied and many more remail unknow to science. Roza is a biological researcher whose role is to discover and document these bacteria. In particular Roza is interested in bacterial species that have ability to synthesize proteins that taste like beef. Her lab has partnered with Improbable Beef, a food startup to research candidate species. Labs across the country have had success in synthesizing meat from algae, fungi, and microorganisms found on plant roots. However, Improbable Beef is still searching for the elusive bacteria that will provide the perfect taste. Roza has a hypothesis that there’s a microorganism that can supply the next best taste, and she believes it can be found quite close to home with bacteria found on the human body. Here’s what Roza knows so far. The human body is a source of thousands of types of bacteria, and different parts of the body harbor different species. Bacteria found in the gut are not the same as species that are found on a person’s eyelashes for example. Furthermore, between individuals the bacterial species may vary even in the same location. Roza hypothesizes that the ideal bacterial species to make synthetic beef, may be found in the belly button, or at least in somebody’s belly button. To test her hypothesis, Roza has sampled the navels of people across the country to identify the bacterial species that colonize our belly buttons. Each person’s identity is anonymous. They’ve instead been assigned an ID number. Now Roza has build a dashboard for you to visit, select an ID, and see which bacteria live in a certain navel. </p>
